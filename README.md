# Reinforcement Learning Notes

> The [source-code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On) is based on the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands On](https://www.packtpub.com/data/deep-reinforcement-learning-hands-on-second-edition) book. Which I highly recommend reading and using as a reference to various techniques and concepts within ***RL***. The author is also creator of [ptan](https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan) library - An implementation of [AgentNet](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet) library for PyTorch.

**NOTE** *The code in this repo has been re-written line-by-line as a learning strategy. Refer to the links aforementioned above for the original implementation.*
